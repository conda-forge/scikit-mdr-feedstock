  summary: |
    A sklearn-compatible Python implementation of Multifactor Dimensionality
    Reduction (MDR) for feature construction.

  description: |
    MDR is an effective feature construction algorithm that is capable of
    modeling higher-order interactions and capturing complex patterns in data
    sets.

    MDR currently only works with categorical features and supports both binary
    classification and regression problems. We are working on expanding the
    algorithm to cover more problem types and provide more convenience features.
